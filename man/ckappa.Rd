\title{Computes Cohen's Kappa for agreement in the case of 2 raters.}
\usage{
ckappa(observed, predicted)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{The vector of observed values (truth).}

\item{predicted}{The vector of predicted values.}
}
\description{
Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient value is a robust statistical measure of inter-rater agreement published in 1960 by Jacob Cohen. It has been reused by numerous studies in sleep medicine to measure the accuracy of predictions, especially for automatic sleep staging.
